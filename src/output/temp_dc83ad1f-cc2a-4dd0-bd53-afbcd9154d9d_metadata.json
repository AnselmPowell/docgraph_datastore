It also creates a platform for the common people who have the ability to attract \nthe audience using their talent. We can take the example of various blog writers, online \ncouncilors and fashion influencers who have a large audience because of their quality \ncontent and knowledge in their field. We have generally seen how the electronic com-\npanies have marked their presence on the online platform via the website which ena-\nbles the users to contact the company easily. Online retail companies interact with the \nusers via website and provide the orders at the doorsteps of the people. There are var-\nious news agencies which had created their website which keeps the users updated \nwith the latest national and international articles. The website development has helped \nto create a link between the people and the companies, but behind all these facilities \nthere is a powerful language and commands that holds these computational activities \nand data transfers which helps to create a good interaction between the users and the \nwebsite owners. Web developers are classified into Front-end and Back-end web devel-\nopers, Front-end developers help to create an interactive interface that can be easily \naccessed by the users, whereas Back-end development deals with the main work that \nis done behind the screens. We can say that it helps to power the website by managing \ndata transfer and other computational activities. In this project, the importance of \nDjango and back-end web development is explained. Using the tools and commands of \nthese languages we can make an interactive and user-friendly interface that can be \neasily accessed by people. Back-end was earlier known for limited purposes but now \nwhen it is explored thoroughly proved to be one of the best languages for website de-\nvelopment, gaming, Artificial Intelligence, and highly advanced mobile applications. \nKeywords \nWeb Development, Django, Python, Backend \nOpen Access",

Introduction  \nThe basics of web development using Django to build blog applications that have the (CRUD) Create, Read, Update, Delete \nfunctionality. Django is a widely used free, open-source, and high-level web development framework.[5] It provides a lot of \nfeatures to the developers \"out of the box,\" so development can be rapid. However, websites built from it are secured, scalable, \nand maintainable at the same time. \n2. Objective \nThe goal of this project is to build a blog application and a Web App (Weather app) which are updated through an administra-\ntion panel. \n  \n3. Virtual Environment \nVirtual Environment act as dependencies to Python-related project. It works as a self-contained container or an isolated envi-\nronment where all Python-related package [5] and the required versions related to specific project are installed. Since new \nversions of Python, Django, or packages, etc. will roll out,[4] through the help of a Virtual Environment, you can work with \nolder versions that are specific to any project. \n \nSteps to create a Virtual Environment: \n1.To create the new directory named 'project-blog' by using 'mkdir' command in your Desktop. \n2.Change the directory to 'project-blog' by using 'cd' command. \n \n \n \n3.The virtual environment is created by using 'python -m venv env', where env is our virtual environment shown by 'ls' com-\nmand. \n \n \n4.For Activating your Virtual Environment: The Virtual Environment can be activated by using the 'source' command where the \n'Scripts' folder needs to be enabled or activated.",

'Object \nRelational Mapper (ORM)' is used which makes it uncomplicated to work with the database. The true database code is not \nwritten, since the database tables are created through the help of 'class' keyword in 'models.py'. \n \n Inside 'blog/models.py', we are creating a new model named 'Post'. This is a class will become a database table after that \nwhich currently inherits from models. As in a standard blog, a certain 'Post' contains a title, which will be a field called Char \nField. It is a text-based column and accepts mandatory argument as 'max_length', which happens to be 50 in our case. Also, \nthere is another field named 'content', which is the Text Field, which contains the detail text of the 'Post' as in a standard blog. \nThe double underscore('str') method is defined, which overrides the field 'title' and returns the name of actual 'title' instead \nof some objects.",

Create a Web App (Weather App) \nLet us build a simple Django application that displays the weather of various cities. To get current weather data, let us use \nthe Open Weather Map API. We will work with the database and create a form, therefore the concepts used here can be \napplicable for more complicated projects.  \nThe Admin Dashboard: Next we will look at admin dashboard given by Django. To do that, 1st we have to migrate the database, \nwhich means Django will generate the pre-defined tables that is needed for the default apps. To do this, run the migrate com-\nmand.[8]  \n• \npython manage.py migrate",
    "9": "A. Chandiramani et al. \n \n \nISSN (Online) : 2583-1798 \n9 \nJournal of Management and Service Science \n(JMSS) \nA2Z Journals \n \nBy running this command, Django has generated an SQLite database for us, default database in our settings, and it has added \nseveral tables to our database. we will know if our database was created if we see a new db.sqlite3 file in our project directory. \nOne of the table Django gives you is a user table, which can be used to store users in our app. The app we are building does \nnot need to have any users having the admin user will allow you to access the admin dashboard. To create the admin user, we \nwill run the create superuser command. \n• \npython manage.py createsuperuser \n \nGive a username, email address, and a password for your admin user. Once you have done it, you will need to start your server \nagain and navigate to admin dashboard. \n• \npython manage.py runserver \n \nThen go to server/admin. We can go to that page is because admin is set up in your urls.py. If we log in with the username, \npassword we just created, we should see the Django Admin Dashboard. Groups & users represent two models Django give us \naccess to. Model are just codes representations of tables in the database. Even though Django created additional tables, there \nis no need to access the rest of them directly, therefore no models were created. Now leave the admin dashboard for now & \ngo to the code. We are required to create an app into our project for the weather app. \n5.1. Creating the App \nWe are required to create a new application to handle everything regarding the weather. To create that app: \n \n• \npython manage.py startapp weather \n \nBy startapp, Django has add a new directory & more files to our project. The newly files generated, let’s create another file \ncalled urls.py in the app directory. \n \nurls.py \nfrom django.urls import path \n \nurlpatterns = [ \n] \n \nThis file is same as to the urls.py in our weather directory. The distinction is that this urls.py file contain all the URL that are \nrelevant to this app itself. We are not specifying a URL yet, rather we can set up our project to recognize the app and route any \nURL specific to the app urls.py file. First, check the INSTALLED_APPS list and then add this app to the list. \n \nthe_weather/the_weather/settings.py \n... \n \nINSTALLED_APPS = [ \n    'django.contrib.admin',",

Chandiramani et al.  \n \n \nISSN (Online) : 2583-1798 \n10 \nJournal of Management and Service Science \n(JMSS) \nA2Z Journals \n \n    'django.contrib.auth', \n    'django.contrib.contenttypes', \n    'django.contrib.sessions', \n    'django.contrib.messages', \n    'django.contrib.staticfiles', \n    'weather', \n] \n \n... \n \nThis lets Django know that we want to use our weather app in the project. By doing that, Django will know where the migrations \nand the URL are. Afterward, we need to modify the main urls.py to point to our weather app urls.py file. To do that, we add on \na line under the existing path for admin dashboard. We are also required to import include so we can point to our \napp urls.py file. \n \nthe_weather/the_weather/urls.py \nfrom django.contrib import admin \nfrom django.urls import path, include \n \nurlpatterns = [ \n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls), \n    path('', include('weather.urls')), \n] \n \nThe null string means that we won’t utilize an endpoint for the entry point to our app. Instead we’ll let our app handle any \nspecific endpoint. We could have put up something like path [‘weather/’, …], which would have meant we would have to \ntype server/weather/ to get anything with our weather app. \n5.2. Adding the Template and View \nNext, we need to add template to our project. A template in Django is an HTML file that allow for extra syntax that make the \ntemplate dynamic. We will be able to do things like add variables, if statement, and loops, among all other things.[9] We have \nan HTML files, but this will be enough for you to start. We are going to create a template directory to put that file in. \n \n• \ncd weather \n• \nmkdir templates && cd templates \n• \nmkdir weather \n \nWe created another directory with the similar name as our application. We did this because Django combine all the template \ndirectories by the various apps we have. To prevent filename being duplicated, we can take the name of our app to prevent",
    "11": "A. Chandiramani et al. \n \n \nISSN (Online) : 2583-1798 \n11 \nJournal of Management and Service Science \n(JMSS) \nA2Z Journals \n \ncreating the duplicates. Inside of our weather directory, creating a new file called index.html. This will be the main template. \nWe have our template created, let us create a view and URL combined so we can actually have this in our app. Views in Django \nare either functions or classes. since we are creating a simple view, we will create a function. Add this function to your views.py: \n \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \nfrom django.shortcuts import render \n \ndef index(request): \n    return render(request, 'weather/index.html') #returns the index.html template \n \nWe are naming our view index because this will be at index of the app, which is the root URL. having the template render, we \nwould return request, which is must for the render function, & the name of our template file we want to render, like in this \ncase weather/index.html. Let’s add this URL that will send this request to this view. The urls.py for this app, update the urlpat-\nterns list. \n \nthe_weather/weather/urls.py \nfrom django.urls import path \nfrom . import views \n \nurlpatterns = [ \n    path('', views.index),  #the path for our index view \n] \n \nThis allows us to refer the view we created. Django goes to match any URL without the endpoint and route it to view function \ncreateded by us. Go back to your project root, start the server again. \n \n• \npython manage.py runserver \n \nWhat we can see now is just the result of HTML you have in index.html file. You will see an input to add cities and the weather \nfor Lucknow. However, the form does not work, and the weather is nothing more than a placeholder, Now we’ll be creating \nthose for this app. \n5.3. Using the Weather API \nWhat we need to do now is have to sign up for the “Open Weather Map API”. This will allow us get real-time weather for any \ncity that we add in our app[1][2][3]. Now we go to the site, create an account, and then go to the API keys on their dashboard. \nEnter a name & generate a new API key. This key allows us to use the API for obtaining the weather. The 1 endpoint we will \nuse is shown below, so you can see following data that gets returned from modifying the following URL with our API key and \nnavigating to the URLs in your browser [1][2][3]. It takes a few minutes for our API key to become active http://api.openweath-\nermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=lucknow&units=imperial&appid=YOUR_APP_KEY",
    "12": "A. Chandiramani et al.  \n \n \nISSN (Online) : 2583-1798 \n12 \nJournal of Management and Service Science \n(JMSS) \nA2Z Journals \n \nWith this, let us add in a request to obtain the data into our app. First, we will need to install request so we can call our API \nfrom inside our app. \n• \npipenv install requests \n \nLet us update our index view so to send a request to our URL we have. \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \nfrom django.shortcuts import render \nimport requests \n \ndef index(request): \n    url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={}&units=imperial&ap-\npid=YOUR_APP_KEY' \n    city = 'Lucknow' \n    city_.weather = requests.get(url.format(city)).json()  \n \n    return render(request, 'weather/index.html') #returns the index.html template \n \nWith those 3 lines, we are adding the URL that we would send a request to. We will make the part for the city just a placeholder \nfor when we allow user to add their own city. For now, we will set the city to be Lucknow, but later this will be set to the cities \nfrom the database. Now run the server again and we can see the details of the city regarding the weather \n5.4. Displaying the Data in the Template \nNext, we need to pass the data to the template so it can be displayed to the user. Let’s create a dictionary to hold all of the \ndata we need. Of the data returned, we need temperature, description, and icon. \n \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \ndef index(request): \n    ... \n    weather = { \n        'city' : city, \n        'temperature' : city_weather['main']['temp'], \n        'description' : city_weather['weather'][0]['description'], \n        'icon' : city_weather['weather'][0]['icon'] \n    } \n \n    return render(request, 'weather/index.html') #returns the index.html template",

Chandiramani et al. \n \n \nISSN (Online) : 2583-1798 \n13 \nJournal of Management and Service Science \n(JMSS) \nA2Z Journals \n \nNow that we have the information we need, we can pass that to our template. To pass it to our template, we’ll create a variable \nnamed context. This will be a dictionary which will allow us to use its values inside our template. \n \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \ndef index(request): \n    ... \n    context = {'weather' : weather} \n    return render(request, 'weather/index.html', context) #returns the index.html template \n \nAnd then in render, we will add the context as the 3rd argument. With the weather data add inside of context, let us go to the \ntemplate to add our data. Inside of the template, all we want to do is modify our HTML to use variables rather than values I \ntyped in. Variables will be using {{}} tags [9], and they will refer to anything inside of our context dictionary. Note: Djangcity will \ngive you the city name. We do not use weather['city'] like we would in Python. With all the variables replaced, we should now \nsee the current weather for our city. We will create a table in the database to hold the city that we want to know the weather \nfor. We will create a model for this. Let us go to the models.py file in your weather app, and add the following: \n \nthe_weather/weather/models.py \nfrom django.db import models \n \nclass City(models.Model): \n    name = models.CharField(max_length=25) \n \n    def _str_(self):  \n        return self.name \n \n    class Meta:  \n        verbose_name_plural = 'cities' \n \nThis will create a table in the database that will have a column named name, which is the cities name. This city will be a-\ncharfield, which is a string. To get the changes in our database, we have should run make migrations to generate the code that \nupdates the database and migrate to apply for those changes. python manage.py makemigration. Python manage.py migrate: \nWe need to make it so we can see this model from our admin dashboard. To achieve that, we need to register this in our ad-\nmin.py file. \n \nthe_weather/weather/admin.py \nfrom django.contrib import admin from .models import City admin.site.register(City) \nThe city is added as an option on the admin dashboard. We can then add some cities into the admin dashboard. I’ll start with \nthree: Ludhiana, Tamil Nadu, and Lucknow[3]. With the entries in the database, we need to query these entries in our view. \nStart by import the City model and then query that model for all objects.",

Creating the Form \nThe last thing we need to do is allow our user to add a city straight in the form. For that, we need to generate a form. We could \ngenerate the form directly, but since our form will have exact same field as our model, we can use our ModelForm.

To do that, let us update the index video that \nwill create the form. We will replace the old city variable the same time because we no longer need it. We can also need to \nupdate context so the form gets passed to the template. \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \ndef index(request): \n    ... \n    form = CityForm() \n \n    weather_data = [] \n    ... \n    context = {'weather_data' : weather_data, 'form' : form}",

With the form in HTML working, we now want to handle the form data as this comes in[9]. For \nthat, we’ll write an if block checking for the POST request. We want to add the check for this type of request before we start \ngrabbing our weather data, so we immediately obtain the data for the city we add. \n \nthe_weather/weather/views.py \ndef index(request): \n    cities = City.objects.all()  \n \n    url \n= \n'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={}&units=imperial&ap-\npid=YOUR_APP_KEY' \n \n    if request.method == 'POST':  \n        form = CityForm(request.POST)  \n        form.save()  \n \n    form = CityForm() \n    ... \n \nBy passing request.POST, we will be able to validate our form data. Now you should be able to type in the name of a city, click \nadd, and see it show up. I will add Mumbai as the next city. When we drop out of the if block, the form will be recreated so we \ncan add another city if we choose. \nConclusion \nWe now have a way to keep track of the weather for multiple cities in our app. We had to work with various parts of Django to \nget this working: views, models, forms, and templates. We also had to use the Python library requests to get the actual weather \ndata[1][2][3]. \nAcknowledgements \nWhen I look at the precious knowledge, I have gained till date in my B.
