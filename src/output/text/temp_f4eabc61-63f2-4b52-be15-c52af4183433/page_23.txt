Figure 17: Percentage of snapshots with changes in the CI/CD technology stack
from the previous snapshot by year for the set of repositories active from 2012
to 2023 (n=8296).
The percentage of CI/CD technology stack changes is significant and is con-
sistently higher in long-running projects, meaning projects continuously look
for technologies that better fit their workflow. Although one could expect some
stability over the years for mature projects, this is not the case as can been seen
in the data. This reinforces the need for the research community to provide
support for these changes.

Discussion
We have analyzed the 12 years of the usage of CI/CD. Answering RQ1, from the
more than 600 thousand repositories collected, almost one third, 32.7%, includes
CI/CD technologies. This number is expected to grow as many projects start
without the usage of CI/CD, which is added in later phases. We can also see one
of the current technologies dominates the market, with 57.8% of the projects
using GitHub Actions. This number may be biased as we used GitHub as our
source of projects, but, if this is the case, it means the source code manager has
a significant impact in the choice of CI/CD technologies.
Regarding the relationship with programming languages, it is possible to
