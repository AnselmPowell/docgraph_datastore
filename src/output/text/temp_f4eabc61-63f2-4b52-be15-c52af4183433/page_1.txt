Abstract
DevOps is a combination of methodologies and tools that improves
the software development, build, deployment, and monitoring processes
by shortening its lifecycle and improving software quality. Part of this
process is CI/CD, which embodies mostly the first parts, right up to
the deployment.
Despite the many benefits of DevOps and CI/CD, it
still presents many challenges promoted by the tremendous proliferation
of different tools, languages, and syntaxes, which makes the field quite
challenging to learn and keep up to date.
Software repositories contain data regarding various software practices,
tools, and uses. This data can help gather multiple insights that inform
technical and academic decision-making. GitHub is currently the most
popular software hosting platform and provides a search API that lets
users query its repositories.
Our goal with this paper is to gain insights into the technologies de-
velopers use for CI/CD by analyzing GitHub repositories. Using a list of
the state-of-the-art CI/CD technologies, we use the GitHub search API
to find repositories using each of these technologies. We also use the API
to extract various insights regarding those repositories. We then organize
and analyze the data collected.
From our analysis, we provide an overview of the use of CI/CD tech-
nologies in our days, but also what happened in the last 12 years. We
also show developers use several technologies simultaneously in the same
project and that the change between technologies is quite common. From
these insights, we find several research paths, from how to support the use
of multiple technologies, both in terms of techniques, but also in terms of
human-computer interaction, to aiding developers in evolving their CI/CD
pipelines, again considering the various dimensions of the problem.
