There are a few key things to notice from this output. First, the three scripts are recognized
as untracked files because you have not told Git to start tracking anything yet. Second, the
word “commit” is Git terminology for a snapshot. As a noun, it means “a version of the code,”
e.g., “the figure was generated using the commit from yesterday” (Box 1). This word can also
be used as a verb, meaning “to save,” e.g., “to commit a change.” Lastly, the output explains
how you can track your files using git add. Start tracking the file process.sh.
$ git add process.sh
And check its new status.
$ git status
On branch master
