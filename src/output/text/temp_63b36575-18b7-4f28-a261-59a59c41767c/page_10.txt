comparison, the majority of other technologies exhibit significantly lower us-
age rates in contrast to these leading two. Notably, among the 39 technologies
analyzed, only ten surpass the 1% usage threshold across CI/CD repositories.

mic scale).
The predominance of GitHub Actions seems to indicate that repository plat-
forms have quite some influence, at least in the projects they hold. Thus, a
possible conclusion is that, when considering the usage of CI/CD technology,
developers also consider where the code will be managed.
CI/CD and programming languages
Fig. 3 illustrates the number of repositories of each programming language with
a usage rate exceeding 1% in repositories employing at least one CI/CD tech-
nology. We use the GitHub API to get the main programming language of each
repository (which does not mean the project does not use other languages).
Notably, based on this depiction, JavaScript and Python emerge as the most
extensively utilized languages. In absolute terms, these languages are the ones
where more projects include CI/CD technologies.
A comparison of the lan-
guages highlighted in the IEEE Spectrum’s top programming languages of 2023
[IEEE(2023)] reveals noteworthy disparities. While SQL and R claim top posi-
tions in IEEE Spectrum’s ranking, they are absent from our list. This discrep-
ancy may be attributed to SQL often being embedded within other program-
ming languages and R being predominantly utilized by less technically inclined
