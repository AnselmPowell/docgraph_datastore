When teams are working on the same code risk of breaking the software is large. CI auto-
mates the building of the packages. Continuous integration checks packages which keeps the 
system up and running as a quality control. 
 
“Build acts as a process of putting source code together and verifying that software works as 
a cohesive unit”-Duvall Paul- continuous integration  
 
In the picture is CI system performance process and how they are working together. 
 
 
 
Appendix 2: The system components of a CI 
 
1) The CI process starts with the developer committing source code to the repository 
(database to store the code). After that, the CI server is polling this repository for 
changes in the integration build machine. The polling time definded by the developer or 
tester.  
 
2) After committing to the repository, CI server uses the latest copy of the code and then 
executes the build script.  
 
3) Than CI server send the results to the specified members of the team, this feature can be 
also modified separately.  
 
CI requires four features. CI-server continuously polls for changes in repository 
• connection to a version control repository  
• automated build script  
• some feedback mechanism (such as e-mail)  
• the process for integrating the source code changes (manual/automated)
