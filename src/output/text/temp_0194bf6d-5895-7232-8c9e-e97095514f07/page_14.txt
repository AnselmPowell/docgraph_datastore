Robot Framework is open source test automation framework written in Python scripting lan-
guage. It is used to write acceptance tests using keyword concept. Keywords are short com-
mands, which are provided by different libraries. (Turnquist, G., L. 2011) 
Test data represents using different formats, like THML (Hypertext Markup Language), 
TSV(Tab-Separated Values), plain text or rest (Restructured Text). 
After defining custom keywords, robot framework maps keywords to Python code.
