Continuous Integration (CI) the process that is performing tasks continuously itself. Software 
development and its testing started a new era, which allows making the process productive 
and faster. 
 
It has been one of the fast growing industries in many parts of businesses. By the years devel-
opment techniques has been improving and produced a quality product to the client in a 
shorter period. The competition raised, but expense of the production got smaller. 
 
Automation testing is a testing model that allows performing test automatically. As a part of 
the continuous integration, it gives great benefits and opportunities. 
The main task of this thesis was to build an environment for continuous Integration test au-
tomation. It allows execute the unit tests automatically using Jenkins as a tool. 
 
Secondly write several Unit tests for testing only one particular part of the code for correct 
output and start running these tests in the new automated environment. 
As a result of this project, stable automated CI environment for the execution of unit tests.
