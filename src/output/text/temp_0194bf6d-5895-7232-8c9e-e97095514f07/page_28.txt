Future suggestions 
 
In the future, client could add more features into system by adding more plugins, for example 
in the result prints. Another suggestion to write unit tests for the rest of robot framework 
source code, that all possible fails would be easy to track on the early stage of development. 
Also, continue write unit tests, during development phase; when creating new keyword, or 
adding a new features to old data.
