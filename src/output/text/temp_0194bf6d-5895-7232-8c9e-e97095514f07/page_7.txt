Module/Unit Testing 
 
Unit testing ensures correct behavior, specific action or logic of software unit. The unit is 
separate software component. Its success or failure authenticates or rejects a single unit, 
individual hardware, software unit, or group of related units. It very first partial test as soon 
as some feature is developed. Unit tests have to be written through all development process. 
It is essential to unit test the feather before combining it with other software additionally 
after combination failure is hard to find. Can be executed two different ways manually and
