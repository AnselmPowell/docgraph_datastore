Fig 4. Contributing to open source projects. We would like you to add an empty file that is named after your GitHub username to the repo used to write this
manuscript. (A) Using your internet browser, navigate to https://github.com/jdblischak/git-for-science. (B) Click on the “Fork” button to create a copy of this
repo on GitHub under your username. (C) On your computer, type git clone https://github.com/username/git-for-science.git, which will create a copy of git-
for-science on your local machine. (D) Navigate to the readers directory by typing cd git-for-science/readers/. Create an empty file that is titled with
your GitHub username by typing touch username.txt. Commit that new file by adding it to the staging area (git add username.txt) and committing
with a message (git commit -m "Add username to directory of readers."). Note that your commit identifier will be different than what is shown
here. (E) You have committed your new file locally, and the next step is to push that new commit up to the git-for-science repo under your username on
GitHub. To do so, type git push origin master. (F) To request to add your commits to the original git-for-science repo, issue a pull request from the git-
for-science repo under your username on GitHub. Once your Pull Request is reviewed and accepted, you will be able to see the file you committed with your
username in the original git-for-science repository.
