4.2. Changing in our Models 
Django uses 'SQLite' as a default database, which is light can only be used for small projects, that is fine for this project. 'Object 
Relational Mapper (ORM)' is used which makes it uncomplicated to work with the database. The true database code is not 
written, since the database tables are created through the help of 'class' keyword in 'models.py'. 
 
 Inside 'blog/models.py', we are creating a new model named 'Post'. This is a class will become a database table after that 
which currently inherits from models. As in a standard blog, a certain 'Post' contains a title, which will be a field called Char 
Field. It is a text-based column and accepts mandatory argument as 'max_length', which happens to be 50 in our case. Also, 
there is another field named 'content', which is the Text Field, which contains the detail text of the 'Post' as in a standard blog. 
The double underscore('str') method is defined, which overrides the field 'title' and returns the name of actual 'title' instead 
of some objects.
