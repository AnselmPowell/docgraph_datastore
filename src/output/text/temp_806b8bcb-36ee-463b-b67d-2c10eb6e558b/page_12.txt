demonstrates higher popularity in JavaScript projects, while GitHub Actions is
more prominently employed in Python projects. This trend may be attributed
to the synchronized growth of GitHub Actions and the increasing popularity
of Python. Furthermore, GitHub Actions emerges as the preferred technology
across most programming languages.
This analysis suggests that programming languages experiencing heightened
popularity in recent years, like Python and TypeScript, are more commonly
associated with GitHub Actions. Conversely, languages such as JavaScript are
more prevalent in projects utilizing Travis. This observation implies that newer
projects tend to favor GitHub Actions, indicating a potential trend of migration
from Travis to GitHub Actions, particularly in numerous JavaScript projects.

RQ2:
Can a single CI/CD technology ade-
quately meet the needs of a specific project?
With this RQ we intend to understand the co-usage of several CI/CD technolo-
gies among the projects.
Fig. 6 displays the logarithmic distribution of the number of CI/CD technolo-
gies employed across repositories with at least one such technology. A notable
