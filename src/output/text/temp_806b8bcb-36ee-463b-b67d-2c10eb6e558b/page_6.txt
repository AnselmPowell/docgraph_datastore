CI/CD Technologies
Following the collection phase, our objective was to discern the technologies
employed in each repository. We used a dataset of 61 CI/CD technologies cu-
rated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation [Study(2023)], established
by the Linux Foundation in 2015. We identified pertinent artifacts and pat-
terns for each technology in the dataset, enabling us to automatically recognize
repositories utilizing those technologies.
This process involved analyzing file
trees accessed through the GitHub REST API and scrutinizing file contents
with extensions compatible with the respective technologies. Each technology
was identified using one of two heuristics: i) some technologies use files with a
particular extension; ii) for the others, we inspected specific types of files (e.g.,
YAML files) searching for content specific to the underlying technology. From
this process, we divided the initial 61 technologies into different categories: i)
39 technologies that we could identify (Table 1); ii) 10 which we could not
identify since there was not a clear artifact that we could use (Table 2); iii) 4
