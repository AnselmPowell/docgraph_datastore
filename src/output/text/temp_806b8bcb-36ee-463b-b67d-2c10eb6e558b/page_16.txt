in a given year, by year.
but most significantly with Travis. Travis itself is quite used with AppVeyor
and Drone with Kubernetes.
The stronger combinations deserve more attention as they represent more
use cases and in particular more users the research community may help.
Finally, in Fig. 5, we present the average number of CI/CD technologies
used across different programming languages (we use the same set of languages
as in RQ1). As can be seen, all the projects written in these languages use, on
average, more than one CI/CD technology.
This reinforces our previous conclusions: the usage of multiple technologies
is quite present and deserves further study and support.

RQ3: What is the evolution of CI/CD usage
over time?
With this RQ, we intend to understand the usage of CI/CD over the last 12
years.
We start by analyzing the usage of CI/CD starting in 2012 until now. For
Fig. 12, we count the number of repositories created each year where, in their
last commit, there is the presence of CI/CD technologies. As can be seen, even
in repositories from 2012, almost one quarter included at least one technology;
