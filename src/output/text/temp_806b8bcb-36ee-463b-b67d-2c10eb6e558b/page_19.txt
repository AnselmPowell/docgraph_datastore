Figure 12: The usage of CI/CD per year.
usage stops being considered. This methodology applies to all charts showing
technology usage over time.
Fig. 14 shows two significant trends in CI/CD, Travis and GitHub Actions.
Travis usage steadily increased from 2012 until it peaked in 2019 with 73284
repositories (36.6%). Since 2019, Travisâ€™s usage has been declining. This coin-
cides with the rapid adoption of GitHub Actions; from 2019 to 2020, there was
a 502.8% growth in the number of repositories using GitHub Actions, and from
2020 to 2021, there was an 86.6% growth. Of the 36587 repositories that used
Travis in 2019 and were still active in 2023, 59.7% were using GitHub Actions
and not Travis in 2023, 21.1% used Travis and not GitHub Actions, and 16.9%
used both. Of the 87582 repositories using GitHub Actions in 2023, 45.4% had
no snapshots from before 2020. The exodus from Travis and the influx from
newer repositories have been the main drivers for GitHub Actions growth.
From this data, we can see a shift in the CI/CD technologies used over the
years. This could mean developers tend to change their technologies and may
need support for doing so. We thus investigate this shift further on.
Fig. 15 shows the top 10 CI/CD stack transitions from repositories that
solely used Travis in 2019. While many stop being active, 22.9% moved from
Travis to GitHub Actions. If we consider only the ones active, this 53.7% of all
active Travis projects moved to GitHub Actions while.
From this information, we can conclude that developers actually change
CI/CD technologies. However, there is little support for this kind of change.
