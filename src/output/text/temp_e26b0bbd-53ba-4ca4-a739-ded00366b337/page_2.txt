Introduction
In 2022 the Information Technology (IT) market accounted for $9,325.69 bil-
lion dollars worldwide [Company(2022)].
Half of IT costs are related to the
maintenance and upkeep of existing systems, and of those, 50% correspond to
emergencies, unplanned work, and changes [Kim et al.(2016)]. This cost hap-
pens partially because the IT and development team’s goals often conflict in
most organizations. Instead of working for a common goal, most organizations’
development teams are responsible for reacting to and answering rapid changes
in markets and customer needs. In contrast, IT teams provide customers with
a secure, reliable, and stable experience. This dynamic leads to technical debt,
meaning decisions made over time lead to increasingly more complex problems
and slower operations and thus impede the achievement of the organization’s
goals [Kim et al.(2016)].
In recent years, DevOps, that is, the integration of development and IT
teams seamlessly, has emerged to enable organizations to respond to market de-
mands with unparalleled agility hoping to address the aforementioned problems.
In particular, methodologies and technologies for Continuous Integration, Con-
tinuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment, or simply CI/CD, have emerged
as a means for organizations to achieve rapid and frequent delivery of changes.
A CI/CD pipeline encompasses a series of essential steps involved in integrat-
ing and deploying codebase changes [Kim et al.(2016)]. This process involves
the regular integration of new code changes, which undergo automated build-
ing and testing procedures. Subsequently, the validated code is deployed into
production through the CD process [Kim et al.(2016)].
Organization have the option to employ various technologies like GitHub
Actions1, GitLab CI/CD2, Travis CI3, CircleCI4 or Jenkins5. The wide range
of existing technologies makes it harder for researchers and developers to study
and improve the CI/CD process. Indeed, there is no view of the usage of CI/CD
technologies in a global sense, e.g., most used technologies, their evolution over
time, which kinds of projects most rely on CI/CD, and so on.
GitHub is a widely used version control and software hosting service. As of
2023, more than 100 million developers used GitHub, and the platform hosted
over 284 million public repositories [Kyle Daigle(2023)]. GitHub also provides
an API to collect information from its software repositories. With this API,
we can search repositories inside GitHub using parameters such as keywords in
their name and README, size, number of stars, followers, and forks6. The
insights collected using the API help understand various developer behaviors
and have been used in several studies [Haque et al.(2020), Henkel et al.(2020),
Golzadeh et al.(2022), Liu et al.(2023), Calefato et al.(2022)]. Indeed, in this
