Jenkins Result analysis 
 
On figure 13 is Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Jenkins environment after build execution. 
There are several builds completed. Every Jenkins job has as many builds as many modifica-
tions we make to the tests. After every modification, new build is created and performed 
automatically as soon as the source code has been updated. 
There are three jobs at the moment, and two of the jobs have blue bullets and last one is 
red. The first one has thunder, next is cloudy, and the final one is red and thunder. All this 
weather signs describe the performance of the jobs. 
 
Blue means successful run and thunder, failed builds inside the job. The job is still successful, 
but it has many failed builds in it, it means that the test is passing but has some concerns 
that what thunder sign demonstrates. The weather symbol changes from sunny to cloudy and 
at the end of thunder. Sunny is successful build no fails. Cloudy means that there are few 
failed builds in the job.  Thunder shows up whenever jobs build fails. While bullet sign is 
blue, there is no worries. Red means unsuccessful performance of the job; that job has lots of 
failed builds, and the test has failed.
