On this picture, we can see that build 87 is under the progress, so it means that the developer 
made some changes into the source code and committed it into the Subversion version control

in SVN.  
 
It uses the same script that runs all builds. Less than one Job name can be as many builds as 
changes in source code that were committed to the version control.
