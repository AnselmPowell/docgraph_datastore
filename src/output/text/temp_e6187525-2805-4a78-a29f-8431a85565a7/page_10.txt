(red). Machines can also be added to or removed from the 
set. Information about the workloads on the selected 
machines (such as the usages of CPU and memory, number 
of agents running on the LEE and the number of castes 
deployed to the CE) can also be obtained with a click of a 
button and displayed on screen.  
The object code for a caste can be deployed to a CE 
using the caste tab; see Error! Reference source not 
found.. Manual deployment can be easily performed by 
selecting a object code file from the machine’s file system 
and selecting the machine the code is to be deployed to and 
then clicking the deploy button. Manual deployment can be 
recorded, and saved to a configuration file with a click of 
button. Previously recorded deployments can be loaded to 
CIDE and automatically executed when a set of object codes 
needs to be deployed again after testing and debugging. The 
list of castes deployed to a CE can also be obtained and 
displayed on screen.
