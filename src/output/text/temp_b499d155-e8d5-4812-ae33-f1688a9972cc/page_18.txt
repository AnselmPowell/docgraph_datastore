the percentage then increased until 2015 to more than 37%, and has been since
then in a gentle descending/stable curve. The drop in the last year is justified
because many projects start without CI/CD, and only later, it is introduced.
As seen in Fig. 13, CI/CD technologies are being integrated into the devel-
opment workflow sooner as time goes on. CI/CD’s increasing popularity is due
to older, possibly more complex, projects’ adoption and new, perhaps simpler,
projects that see value in continuous practices. The sharp decreases in 2022 and
2023 come from all analyzed repositories having at least one CI/CD technology
in 2023.
Usage of different technologies
A repository may use more than one technology at a time, as seen in Fig. 14. The
technologies used in a repository in a given year are the union of the technologies
of the snapshots retrieved in that year. In cases where a repository does not
have any snapshots in a given year but has activity following that year, the
technologies used for that year are the ones in the most recent snapshot up to
that point in time, i.e., if a repository has snapshots in 2016 and 2018, but
not in 2017, its used technologies in 2017 are the ones from the last snapshot
from 2016. If a repository has no activity following a given year, its technology
