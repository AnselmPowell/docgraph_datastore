Thus, the research community has quite an interesting path to explore.
How often do projects change CI/CD technologies?
As Fig. 16 shows, the percentage of snapshots with CI/CD changes compared to
the previous snapshot grows steadily from 2013 (2.3%) to 2019 (6.9%) and peaks
in 2020 (12.2%) and 2021 (12.6%), coinciding with GitHub Actions’s explosive
growth phase. Since 2021, this number has remained stable at almost 8%.
This is a very significant result since it shows that every year, between 2.3%
(in 2013) and 12.6% (in 2021) of all snapshots include some kind of change
in the CI/CD technologies used. This represents a very significant amount of
technologies’ shift, with all the known issues with that. Moreover, it is important
to notice that this constant over time and there is no reason to think this
may change in a near future. This means the research community can give a
significant contribution to aid all these teams when they migrate and evolve
their systems.
If we limit this analysis to a subset of active repositories from 2012 to 2023
(Fig. 17), we find similar trends but higher change percentages over time. For
this analysis, we discarded all snapshots for each repository before the first,
where we detected CI/CD technologies. This was done because we were not
