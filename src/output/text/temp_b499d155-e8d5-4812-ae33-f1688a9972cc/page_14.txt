necessitate the utilization of multiple technologies. This implies that certain
technologies may not be adequate or suitable for specific workloads, prompting
the adoption of a diverse CI/CD technology stack in these instances.
Figure 6: Distribution of the number of technologies in repositories containing
CI/CD technologies (logarithmic scale).
The fact that many projects require using two or more CI/CD technologies
raises several concerns. To the best of our knowledge, the interoperability of
these technologies has not been properly studied. This deserves an investigation
of its own. Moreover, CI/CD supporting tools (e.g., editors) are not tailored
for co-usage, which makes their co-usage more difficult for developers. Thus, to
study how to aid developers in these projects becomes an interesting research
path.
In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we present the number and percentage of repositories us-
ing (at most) a certain number of technologies. Some repositories have no single
technology because, at a certain point (most likely, in their beginning), they did
not use CI/CD. In the first few years, one can see that the vast majority used just
one technology, but that number quickly rose. In the last 4 years, at least 23,000
repositories (per year) use more than one technology (Fig. 9). Note this is si-
multaneous usage, not different usage over time (which we will address in RQ3).
This finding agrees with both Mazrae et al. [Rostami Mazrae et al.(2023)] and
Goldazeh et al. [Golzadeh et al.(2022)] studies of CI usage.
Although in the last few years there seems to be a decrease in the use of
multiple technologies, clearly, there are many repositories still using them that
the research community should try to support.
In Fig. 10 we present a study of the co-usage of two technologies. Not sur-
prisingly, GitHub Actions is used in combination with all the other technologies,
