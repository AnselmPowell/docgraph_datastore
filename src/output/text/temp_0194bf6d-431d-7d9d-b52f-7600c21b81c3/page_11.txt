creating the duplicates. Inside of our weather directory, creating a new file called index.html. This will be the main template. 
We have our template created, let us create a view and URL combined so we can actually have this in our app. Views in Django 
are either functions or classes. since we are creating a simple view, we will create a function. Add this function to your views.py: 
 
the_weather/weather/views.py 
from django.shortcuts import render 
 
def index(request): 
    return render(request, 'weather/index.html') #returns the index.html template 
 
We are naming our view index because this will be at index of the app, which is the root URL. having the template render, we 
would return request, which is must for the render function, & the name of our template file we want to render, like in this 
case weather/index.html. Let’s add this URL that will send this request to this view. The urls.py for this app, update the urlpat-
terns list. 
 
the_weather/weather/urls.py 
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
 
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('', views.index),  #the path for our index view 
] 
 
This allows us to refer the view we created. Django goes to match any URL without the endpoint and route it to view function 
createded by us. Go back to your project root, start the server again.

What we can see now is just the result of HTML you have in index.html file. You will see an input to add cities and the weather 
for Lucknow. However, the form does not work, and the weather is nothing more than a placeholder, Now we’ll be creating 
those for this app. 
5.3. Using the Weather API 
What we need to do now is have to sign up for the “Open Weather Map API”. This will allow us get real-time weather for any 
city that we add in our app[1][2][3]. Now we go to the site, create an account, and then go to the API keys on their dashboard. 
Enter a name & generate a new API key. This key allows us to use the API for obtaining the weather. The 1 endpoint we will 
use is shown below, so you can see following data that gets returned from modifying the following URL with our API key and 
navigating to the URLs in your browser [1][2][3]. It takes a few minutes for our API key to become active http://api.openweath-
