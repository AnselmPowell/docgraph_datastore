Because Git is tracking clean.py, it recognizes that the file has been changed since the
last commit.
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#
(use "git add <file>. . ." to update what will be committed)
#
(use "git checkout --<file>. . ." to discard changes in working
directory)
#
#
modified: clean.py
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
The report from git status indicates that the changes to clean.py are not staged, i.e.,
they are in the working directory (Fig 1). To view the unstaged changes, run the command
git diff.
