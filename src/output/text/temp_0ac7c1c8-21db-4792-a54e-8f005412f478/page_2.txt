collaborations, have found GitHub to be a productive place to share code and ideas and to col-
laborate (see Table 1).
Some of the recommendations outlined below are broadly applicable to repository hosting
services. However, our main aim is to highlight specific GitHub features. We provide a set of
recommendations that we believe will help the reader to take full advantage of GitHubâ€™s fea-
tures for managing and promoting projects in bioinformatics as well as in many other research
domains. The recommendations are ordered to reflect a typical development process: learning
Git and GitHub basics, collaboration, use of branches and pull requests, labeling and tagging of
code snapshots, tracking project bugs and enhancements using issues, and dissemination of the
final results.
Rule 1: Use GitHub to Track Your Projects
The backbone of GitHub is the distributed version control system Git. Every change, from fix-
ing a typo to a complete redesign of the software, is tracked and uniquely identified. Although
Box 1
By default, GitHub repositories are freely visible to all. Many projects decide to share
their work publicly and openly from the start of the project in order to attract visibility
and to benefit from contributions from the community early on. Some other groups pre-
fer to work privately on projects until they are ready to share their work. Private reposito-
ries ensure that work is hidden but also limit collaborations to just those users who are
given access to the repository. These repositories can then be made public at a later stage,
such as, for example, upon submission, acceptance, or publication of corresponding jour-
nal articles. In some cases, when the collaboration was exclusively meant to be private,
some repositories might never be made publicly accessible.
