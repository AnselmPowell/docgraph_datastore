Introduction
Bioinformatics is a broad discipline in which one common denominator is the need to produce
and/or use software that can be applied to biological data in different contexts. To enable and
ensure the replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential that the scientific pub-
lication, the corresponding datasets, and the data analysis are made publicly available [1,2]. All
software used for the analysis should be either carefully documented (e.g., for commercial soft-
ware) or, better yet, openly shared and directly accessible to others [3,4]. The rise of openly
available software and source code alongside concomitant collaborative development is facili-
tated by the existence of several code repository services such as SourceForge, Bitbucket,
GitLab, and GitHub, among others. These resources are also essential for collaborative software
projects because they enable the organization and sharing of programming tasks between dif-
ferent remote contributors. Here, we introduce the main features of GitHub, a popular web-
based platform that offers a free and integrated environment for hosting the source code, docu-
mentation, and project-related web content for open-source projects. GitHub also offers paid
plans for private repositories (see Box 1) for individuals and businesses as well as free plans
including private repositories for research and educational use.
GitHub relies, at its core, on the well-known and open-source version control system Git,
originally designed by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel and now devel-
oped and maintained by the Git community. One reason for GitHub’s success is that it offers
more than a simple source code hosting service [5,6]. It provides developers and researchers
with a dynamic and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform,
that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion [7]. A diverse range of efforts, ranging
from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories, as well as global
