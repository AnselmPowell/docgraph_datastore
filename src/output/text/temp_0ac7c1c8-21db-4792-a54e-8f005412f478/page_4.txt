Due to its distributed design, each up-to-date local Git repository is an entire exact historical
copy of everything that was committed—file changes, commit message logs, etc. These copies
act as independent backups as well, present on each user’s storage device. Git can be considered
to be fault-tolerant because of this, which is a win over centralized version control systems. If
the remote GitHub server is unavailable, collaboration and work can continue between users,
as opposed to centralized alternatives.
The web interface offered by GitHub provides friendly tools to perform many basic opera-
tions and a gentle introduction to a more rich and complex set of functionalities. Various
graphical user-interface-driven clients for managing Git and GitHub repositories are also avail-
able (https://www.git-scm.com/downloads/guis). Many editors and development environments
