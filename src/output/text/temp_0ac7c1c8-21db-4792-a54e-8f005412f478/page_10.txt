projects, which is a common feature in many social media platforms. Take advantage of it as
much as possible!
Conclusions
If you are involved in scientific research and have not used Git and GitHub before, we recom-
mend that you explore its potential as soon as possible. As with many tools, a learning curve
lays ahead, but several basic yet powerful features are accessible even to the beginner and may
be applied to many different use-cases [6]. We anticipate the reward will be worth your effort.
To conclude, we would like to recommend some examples of bioinformatics repositories in
GitHub (Table 1) and some useful training materials, including workshops, online courses, and
manuscripts (Table 2).

The authors would like to thank C. Titus Brown for mentioning the manuscript on social
media, leading to additional contributions and further improvements. We also thank Peter
Cock (peterjc) for helpful suggestions contributed directly through GitHub.
