Add initial version of thesis code.
The commit identifier can be used to compare two different versions of a file, restore a file
to a previous version from a past commit, and even retrieve tracked files if you accidentally
delete them.
Now you are free to make changes to the files knowing that you can always revert them to the
state of this commit by referencing its identifier. As an example, edit clean.py so that the fold
change cutoff for filtering peaks is more stringent. Here is the current bottom of the file.
$ tail clean.py
# Filter based on fold-change over control sample
fc_cutoff = 10
epithelial = epithelial.filter(filter_fold_change,
fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
proximal_tube = proximal_tube.filter(filter_fold_change,
fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
kidney = kidney.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).
saveas()
# Identify only those sites that are peaks in all three tissue types
combined = pybedtools.BedTool().multi_intersect(
i = [epithelial.fn, proximal_tube.fn, kidney.fn])
union = combined.filter(lambda x: int(x[3]) = = 3).saveas()
union.cut(range(3)).saveas(data + "/sites-union.bed")
Using a text editor, increase the fold change cutoff from 10 to 20.
$ tail clean.py
# Filter based on fold-change over control sample
fc_cutoff = 20
epithelial = epithelial.filter(filter_fold_change,
fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
