Fig 2. Working with a local repository. (A) To designate a directory on your computer as a Git repo, type
the command git init. This initializes the repository and will allow you to track the files located within that
directory. (B) Once you have added a file, follow the git add/commit cycle to place the new file first into the
staging area by typing git add to designate it to be committed, and then git commit to take the shapshot of
that file. The commit is assigned a commit identifier (d75es) that can be used in the future to pull up this
version or to compare different committed versions of this file. (C) As you continue to add and change files,
you should regularly add and commit those changes. Here, an additional commit was done, and the commit
log now shows two commit identifiers: d75es (from step B) and f658t (the new commit). Each commit will
generate a unique identifier, which can be examined in reverse chronological order using git log.
