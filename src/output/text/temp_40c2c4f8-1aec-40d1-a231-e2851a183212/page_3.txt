Literature Review: A comprehensive review of 
academic publications and industry reports provided 
an overview of the state-of-the-art in generative AI 
techniques as well as case studies of real-world 
applications. This helped establish the technological 
context. 
Expert Interviews: Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted 
with 
frontend 
engineers 
and 
ML 
researchers 
to 
gain 
insights 
into 
challenges, 
opportunities, and early adoption trends. Interviews 
were anonymized and analyzed for common 
themes[21]. 
Survey Study: An online survey targeting 100+ 
developers collected quantitative data on perceived 
impacts of generative AI on workflows, priorities, and 
skills. Survey questions corresponded directly to the 
research questions. 
Tool Evaluation: Hands-on evaluation of 5 prominent 
generative AI tools like CloudFactory, Anthropic and 
Photon provided a practical perspective on current 
functionality and limitations. 
Design Thinking: A collaborative design exercise with 
5 multidisciplinary participants applied human-
centered design methods to envision generative AI-
augmented frontend processes of the future. 
Ethical Framework: Drawing on prior works, a 
preliminary framework was proposed to guide the 
ethical development and deployment of generative AI 
for frontend uses based on principles of transparency, 
oversight, and fairness. 
The triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data 
sources through multiple methods aimed to develop a 
rigorous 
yet 
nuanced 
understanding 
of 
this 
transformative and fast-moving technological shift. 
5. Study results. 
Early Research in Text Generation 
Based on our evaluation of 5 popular generative AI 
platforms 
- 
Anthropic, 
DALL-E 
2, 
Photon, 
CloudFactory and DeepAI - the key capabilities 
identified include: 
· Text generation through language models of varying 
size (e.g. GPT-3) 
· Image synthesis from text descriptions using 
techniques like DALL-E 2 
· 3D model generation from text or image references 
· Code snippet and program generation for basic tasks. 
· Audio generation for speech synthesis and sound 
effects 
· Limited video generation through frame-by-frame 
synthesis 
While usefulness for frontend tasks varies, text and 
image generation show most promise based on 
functionality and quality of output. 
Perceived Impact on Frontend Workflows 
Expert interviews and surveys revealed generative AI 
is poised to significantly affect prototyping, designing, 
coding, and content workflows through automation of 
repetitive jobs and augmentation of creativity. Key 
perceived impacts include: 
· Faster visual and functional prototyping through 
design/code generation 
· Automated content production for markdown, 
documentation, and websites 
· Augmented testing and bug-finding capabilities 
· Personalized experiences through dynamic content 
synthesis 
· Accessibility enhancements using AI-driven auditing 
tools. 
While automation may disrupt some roles, new types 
of strategic work are expected to emerge according to 
practitioners. 
Technical and Ethical Challenges 
Ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and security of 
generative outputs for mission-critical uses was a 
common concern expressed. Additional challenges 
pertained to the need for: 
· Transparency into model behavior and limitations
