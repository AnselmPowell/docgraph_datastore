Project overview 
 
Unit testing is actual on all levels of software development, and it usually is developed along 
with the production code, but not builds in a final software product. It tests concrete object 
of the code on its performance. (Paul Hamill 2005) Continuous integration testing, set of 
different tools to execute unit test automatically as soon as developer adds new features to 
it. The framework helps developers avoid the broken software.  
 
This work took place at Nokia Networks Espoo office in Karaportti.  The main requirement 
was to set up the Continuous Integration automation testing environment using Jenkins as 
execution unit test tool on the main company server and Python due to the test cases will be 
written in Python scripting language. Connect to the version control, assemble the job and 
test the system functionality by running unit tests.

Jenkins CI-server 
 
Jenkins is Java- based open source Java-based continues integration (CI) server or continuous 
build monitoring tool for execution jobs repeatedly, also known as a test automation testing 
tool. It continuously tracks development errors in the early stage of software development. 
  
Jenkins concentrates on two main tasks: first is to perform testing and second is building pro-
jects continuously. 
Jenkins is one of the largest open source CI build system. Because of its flexibility, hundreds 
of plugins and resilience with different types of systems. It allowing various environments and 
work with multiple process stakeholders involved.
