three project attributes. Unlike owner type, which has only
two enumeration values (“personal user” and “organization”),
project size and forks number are numeric values. For each of
the numeric project attributes, we divide the numeric values
into three groups: small, median, and large. For project size
and forks number, we ﬁrst compute the 1st quartile, the
median, and the 3rd quartile of all values. Projects with the
measure smaller than the 1st quartile are assigned to the
small group. If the value is larger than the 3rd quartile, the
project is assigned to the large group. The remaining projects
are assigned to the median group. Figure 2(a)-2(c) presents
branches used in projects grouped by size, forks number and
owner type respectively. The horizontal axis is the number of
branches used in a project. The vertical axis is the number of
projects which have a certain number of branches. Different
colours represent different groups.
In Figure 2(a), when the number of branches is no more
than three, the numbers of projects with small size, median
size, and large size are similar. When the number of branches
increases above 3, large scale projects tend to represent a much
larger proportion compared to small and median projects.
This means large-scale projects are more likely to use more
branches during development. A similar phenomenon can also
be observed in Figure 2(b). Thus, a more popular project
tends to use more branches during development. As shown in
Figure 2(c), when there are less than eight branches, personal
projects occupy a larger proportion than organization-owned
projects. As the branch count increases, the difference between
two types of projects becomes small. For projects with more
than 30 branches, organization-based projects are the majority.
This suggests that projects created by personal users are
more likely to use fewer branches; while projects created by
organizations are more likely to use more branches during their
development.
Next, we apply Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with Bonferroni
correction [2] and Cliff Delta Effect Size [10] to check
the statistical signiﬁcance of the above-observed differences
between different groups, i.e., user vs. organization, high
vs. median, median vs. low, and high vs. low. We apply

(p-value<0.05): for project size or owner type, all
p-values<2.2e−16; for forks number, the p-values for high
vs. median, median vs. low and high vs. low are 0.024,
2.68e−13 and < 2.2e−16 respectively. However, all differences
except two are small evaluated by the Cliff Delta effect size
(|d|<0.147 "negligible", |d|<0.33 "small",
|d|<0.474 "medium", otherwise "large"):
for
project size, the difference between high and low groups is
large, with effect size value being 0.543 (>0.474); for forks
number, the difference between median and low groups is
negligible, with effect size value being 0.067 (<0.147); all
other differences are small with their effect size values being
larger than 0.147 but smaller than 0.33.
Finding 2. Large scale projects tend to use signiﬁcantly
more branches than small scale projects; popular projects or
projects owned by organizations tend to use slightly more
branches during software development.
Implications. In Finding 1, we note that most (87.9%) projects
use no more than ﬁve branches during their development.
However, it also can be observed that either some projects
(18.3%) only work on the master branch or some projects
(3.1%) use many branches (>30 branches). For these projects,
in-depth analysis is desired. For example, we are not clear on
why some projects create a lot of branches, what problems
they face when they try to manage many branches. Moreover,
why do some projects, including organizational projects which
may involve many developers, only develop on master branch?
In Finding 2, we ﬁnd that more popular, larger or organiza-
tional projects tend to use more branches than others, which
propose more research questions to investigate, e.g., whether
these projects might face more challenges when managing
more branches, and what problems they exactly face and how
do they try to address them. The answers of these research
questions can 1) provide some guidance for other practitioners
who face similar problems, and 2) inspire more researchers or
