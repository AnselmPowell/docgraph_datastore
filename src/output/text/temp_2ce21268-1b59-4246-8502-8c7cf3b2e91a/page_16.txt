With the addition of a GitHub account and a few commands for sending and receiving
code, you can now share your code with others, transfer your code across multiple machines,
and set up simple collaborative workflows.
Contribute to Other Projects
Lots of scientific software is hosted online in Git repositories. Now that you know the basics of
Git, you can directly contribute to developing the scientific software you use for your research
(Fig 4). From a small contribution like fixing a typo in the documentation to a larger change
such as fixing a bug, it is empowering to be able to improve the software used by yourself and
many other scientists.
When contributing to a larger project with many contributors, you will not be able to push
your changes with git push directly to the project’s remote repository. Instead, you will first
need to create your own remote copy of the repository, which on GitHub is called a fork
(Box 1). You can fork any repository on GitHub by clicking the button “Fork” on the top right
of the page (see https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
Once you have a fork of a project’s repository, you can clone it to your computer and make
changes just like a repository you created yourself. As an exercise, you will add a file to the
repository that we used to write this paper. First, go to https://github.com/jdblischak/git-for-
science and choose the “Fork” option to create a git-for-science repository under your GitHub
account (Fig 4B). In order to make changes, download it to your computer with the command
git clone from the directory you wish the repo to appear in (Fig 4C).
$ git clone https://github.com/username/git-for-science.git
Now that you have a local version, navigate to the subdirectory readers and create a text file
named as your GitHub username (Fig 4D).
$ cd git-for-science/readers
$ touch username.txt
Add and commit this new file (Fig 4D), and then push the changes back to your remote
repository on GitHub (Fig 4E).
$ git add username.txt
$ git commit -m "Add username to directory of readers."
$ git push origin master
Currently, the new file you created, readers/username.txt, only exists in your fork
of git-for-science. To merge this file into the main repository, send a pull request using the
GitHub interface (Pull request -> New pull request -> Create pull request; Fig 4F; see https://
help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). After the pull request is created, we can review
your change and then merge it into the main repository. Although this process of forking a
project’s repository and issuing a pull request seems like a lot of work to contribute changes,
this workflow gives the owner of a project control over what changes get incorporated into the
code. You can have others contribute to your projects using the same workflow.
