5. Create a Web App (Weather App) 
Let us build a simple Django application that displays the weather of various cities. To get current weather data, let us use 
the Open Weather Map API. We will work with the database and create a form, therefore the concepts used here can be 
applicable for more complicated projects.

which means Django will generate the pre-defined tables that is needed for the default apps. To do this, run the migrate com-
