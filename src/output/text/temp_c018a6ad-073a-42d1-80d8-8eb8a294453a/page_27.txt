Result analysis, work summary and future suggestions 
 
This work started by learning and understanding about required and needed software to be 
able to perform work successufully. 
 
Through this work was important to learn understand Python scripting language and write a 
first unit test for existing robot framework libraries to be able to run tests in new Jenkins 
server on its correct performance.  
 
During this project, the difficulties faced were with the connecting all pieces together, where 
scripting of routes and paths were important to write correctly, that source code would be 
imported from the right place. That work took several weeks to figure out the right scripts for 
making connections. Learning to understand the source code and its performance was im-
portant, because othervise unit test writing would be impossible. 
 
By the end of the project, all pieces were combined, and the finally system starts to run and 
react to the changes in the source code. Unit test starts to run automatically. Work 
successfully completed.  
 
Integrated Scrum cycle, which was taken in use in the same time, while this project took 
place was challenging. Many times happened that some work due to some issues had to be 
continued next day, sometimes several days.  
 
Overall work was successful and was performed based on the client requirements.
