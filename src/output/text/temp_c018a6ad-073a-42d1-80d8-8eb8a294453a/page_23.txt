Figure 6: Build configuration 
 
Specifying Trigger when build should be triggered, in my case it will be triggered every 1 min 
and checking if something has changed in the repository.Polling means when automated build 
start to run the tests after the code is modified and saved and committed in the Subversion 
(SVN), in this project its takes one minute. As environment variable, in the build execution 
shell path of Virtual NV has been modified. That means that it creates virtual environment 
automatically for the builds that run under this job. 
 
After every update, Jenkins runs the built as many changes made as many times new build 
created. 
In source code management, needed files can be chosen. From the picture above the 
sourcecode, management tool is subversion (SVN). 
In the execution shell, the proxy root is defined in the highly protected network proxy is al-
ways required, to be able to take any information from the outside world.
