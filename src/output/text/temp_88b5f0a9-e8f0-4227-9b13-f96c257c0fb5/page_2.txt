1. Introduction  
The basics of web development using Django to build blog applications that have the (CRUD) Create, Read, Update, Delete 
functionality. Django is a widely used free, open-source, and high-level web development framework.[5] It provides a lot of 
features to the developers "out of the box," so development can be rapid. However, websites built from it are secured, scalable, 
and maintainable at the same time. 
2. Objective 
The goal of this project is to build a blog application and a Web App (Weather app) which are updated through an administra-
tion panel. 
  
3. Virtual Environment 
Virtual Environment act as dependencies to Python-related project. It works as a self-contained container or an isolated envi-
ronment where all Python-related package [5] and the required versions related to specific project are installed. Since new 
versions of Python, Django, or packages, etc. will roll out,[4] through the help of a Virtual Environment, you can work with 
older versions that are specific to any project. 
 
Steps to create a Virtual Environment: 
1.To create the new directory named 'project-blog' by using 'mkdir' command in your Desktop. 
2.Change the directory to 'project-blog' by using 'cd' command. 
 
 
 
3.The virtual environment is created by using 'python -m venv env', where env is our virtual environment shown by 'ls' com-
mand. 
 
 
4.For Activating your Virtual Environment: The Virtual Environment can be activated by using the 'source' command where the 
'Scripts' folder needs to be enabled or activated.
