from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab to search for CI/CD adoption. They find
only around 10% applications leverage CI/CD technologies, a small number
of applications (291) adopt multiple CI/CD technologies, nearly half of the
applications that adopt CI/CD technologies do not really use them, and CI/CD
technologies are useful to improve project popularity. Their approach is similar
to ours however, our analysis is done with a greater sample of 612557 repositories
and we donâ€™t limit ourselves to Android applications.
Calefato et al. [Calefato et al.(2022)] study MLOps (that is, DevOps but
focused on machine learning projects) practices in GitHub repositories, focus-
ing on GitHub Actions and CML. Their preliminary results suggest that the
adoption of MLOps workflows is rather limited. On the other hand, we have
found that, indeed, many projects rely on CI/CD pipelines.
Kumar et al. [Kumar et al.(2022)] assess the maturity of DevOps practices
in the software industry. To this end, they analyze the HELENA2 dataset (an
international survey aiming to collect data regarding the common use of software
and systems in practice). They rank organizations by DevOps maturity. The
authors conducted a user survey while we analyzed software repositories.

Data collection
This section details the process we followed to collect the data for our analysis.
Fig. 1 presents an overall view that we detail in the following paragraphs.
3.1
Repository Sampling
The initial data collection phase involved assembling a representative sample
of GitHub repositories, reflective of real-world projects.
To achieve this, we
excluded school projects and smaller repositories, employing a methodology
inspired by prior research projects. That is, we focused on repositories attaining
a certain level of popularity, ultimately choosing to collect only those with more
than ten stars, accounting for a mere 5% of all GitHub repositories.
The sampling process encompassed repositories from the beginning of 2012 to
October 18, 2023. This timeframe was selected because the concept of DevOps
gained prominence around that period.
This assertion is supported by the
emergence of the first comprehensive survey on the state of DevOps by Puppet
Labs in the same year [by Perforce(2023)].
Leveraging the GitHub REST API, we devised a methodology to identify
the top one thousand repositories with the highest star count each week. That
is, we queried GitHub and got one thousand repositories every week in the time
range. From these, we excluded the ones with fewer than ten stars. This ap-
proach yielded a comprehensive dataset, totaling 612,557 repositories, spanning
the specified date range. The entire dataset of repositories is provided for ref-
erence [Author(2023b)]. The code used to create this dataset is also available
[Anonymous(2023a)].
