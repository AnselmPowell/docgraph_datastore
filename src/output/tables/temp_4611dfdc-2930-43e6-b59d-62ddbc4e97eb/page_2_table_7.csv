,"Pedrycz states that in the past decade, firms have tried"
turning from their original IT team to the specific DevOps group,
or introducing an agile methodology to their software,
development projects [3]. Multiple relationships between these,
two concepts surfaced through these changes in the organization.,
"Agile Teams are focused on automated design, test automation,",
Continuous Integration (CI). According to Forsgren and Humble,
"DevOps teams frequently need to use these tools, as well as",
"metrics and monitoring systems, configuration management,",
"virtualization, and cloud computing [4]. Agile looked like a whole",
new paradigm for software developers who were disappointed by,
the limitations of a waterfall approach. However Agile is not,
perfect according to Forsgren and Humble. Common,
"disadvantages to Agile planning involve missed deadline,",
"completed elements which, owing to separated scrum or groups,",
are incompatible with each other and additional features splitting,
old features â€“ due to the lack of coordination with DevOps and,
ITOps[4]. All these issues are related to Agile development by,
one thing: the breakdown in communication.,
