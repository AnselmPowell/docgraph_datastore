Agile was developed to assist businesses in meeting existing
needs in the world of business and a positive and creative working
climate. In the literature on how Agile strategies interact with
"progress, there has been very little documentation of the"
Organizational Process Improvement Program [18]. Further
"improvements in technological innovation can be shaped, for"
"example, by corporate business models, concurrent design,"
"multisectoral management, and proactive development [19]."
Experts asked on what they felt were the major research issue in
"their disciplines at the 2010 XP meeting in Trondheim,"
Norway mentioned that the location of agile as well as large
ventures has been the top of the list.
