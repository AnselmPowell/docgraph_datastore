"Agile and DevOps are different, even though their correlations"
cause people to assume that they are the same. This is a disservice
to both agile or DevOps. Both help teams to work faster and more
"efficiently, where quality work is delivered and contented"
customers. DevOps is a collaboration-building framework for the
Technology and Operations team. This allows the consumers to
quickly and automatedly deploy code for production. It helps to
speed up the delivery of products and services through an
"organization. With these insights in mind, it is clear that both"
Agile and DevOps strive for a more efficient way to bring the end-
users' valueâ€” but from various angles. It can be defined as
aligning development and IT operation. Agile seeks to improve
"efficiency for developers and release schedules, while DevOps"
brings together the operations team to allow continuous
implementation and continuous delivery [25]. It has also helped
to promote innovative thoughts beyond agile development and
multi-functional (DevOps) as well as end-to-end processes that
affect software companies and customers. Several organizations
have effectively adopted agile techniques to speed up the
development of applications. The days of waterfall strategies are
long gone. Agile has started to grow slowly into other
"downstream sectors, including IT and operations, in the"
"technology organization. Teams, simplified processes, improved"
"feedback loops, and driven IT departments become much faster"
with an innovation that has a profound impact on the whole
"organization. To build on this performance, DevOps, and"
Continuous License (CD) have been built to support and improve
"agility, reactivity, and fast times for marketing over the entire life"
"cycle of software delivery. However, software teams must have a"
high level of understanding of how to deploy and implement these
methodologies. Agile and DevOps are by no means adversaries
(or at least they are not intended). Throughout the agile revolution
they are much more allies than enemies. Both Agile and DevOps
easily work in the same space either Inclusively or exclusively.
