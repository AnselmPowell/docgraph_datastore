,,What occurs after software development defines the

,"software is developed, tested, and deployed. But after these",
,"3 stages, pure agile appears to stop. DevOps, by contrast,",
,includes constant operations [9]. The monitoring and,
,"development of software are therefore continuous. In agile,",
,individual people build and test the software and deploy it.,
,DevOps is all responsible for the role of engineering in,
,DevOps; technology is business and software is business.,
,DevOps is more linked to cost reduction and agile is more,
,"linked with lean and waste reduction, and terms such as agile",
,accounts for projects and a minimum viable product (MVP),
,"are important. Instead of predictive steps, Agile emphasizes",
,"and promotes empiricism (adaptation, openness, and",
,inspection) [10]. When one is not focused on delivering value,
,"to the clients, a well-managed and automated production",
,pipeline does no good [11]. The explanation as to why,
,DevOps and Agile are confused is simple: many of the basic,
,"principles overlap. The word ""continuous delivery"" can also",
,"be correlated with the two: cooperation, pace, feedback loops",
,It is important to understand how and why they are distinct,
,"and, more specifically, how they can complement one",

,Agile focuses solely on the development and deployment of,
software while DevOps tends to add IT to the mix. Both are,,
methodologies that are important for software development [13].,,
The Agile methodology has been in existence for Over 20 years,,
ago while DevOps was recently discovered.,,
