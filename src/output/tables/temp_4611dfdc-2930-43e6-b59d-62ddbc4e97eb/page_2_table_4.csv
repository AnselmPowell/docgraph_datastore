Agile was a response to the approaches in waterfall
"methodologies, but DevOps was not an answer to Agile. Both"
hypotheses are not the same â€“ because businesses have started to
see connections and improved performance and efficiency when
used in tandem. Two important areas were known as IT
"operations (ITOps) and Development Operations (DevOps),"
which are essential for businesses in the modern era. ITOP 's
"functions include guaranteeing safety, compliance, and reliability"
while DevOps is in charge of designing and delivering end-user
with new products. Even as ITOps provides reliability and safety
"for all customer needs via the network, DevOps goes hand in hand"
with flexibility and thorough analysis and communication with
the implementation of new software.
