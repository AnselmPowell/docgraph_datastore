,"Although Agile doesn't always lead to DevOps, the"
culture changes in an organization are profound. An agile,
approach will encourage a change in development thinking[22].,
"Agile thinking encourages tiny, easy-to-use transitions that lead",
"to big improvements over time, rather than thinking of growth as",
cumbersome [23]. Businesses of all sizes have studied how many,
"units can increase their work in an agile way. Currently, some",
companies are Agile. DevOps can however bring about its,
"cultural changes, such as improved communications and stable",
balance with transformation and flexibility [24]. The choice to use,
"both concepts is an active decision, which many analysts think",
could lead to good decision making and therefore to a better,
culture of the business.,
