"The agile methodology also weakens the concept of a ""finished"
"product,"" which was the main objective of the Waterfall approach"
Agile considers the fact that software development should be
iterative and incremental. This means that the customer can
execute new features or improve the existing functions on each
new software launch. Agile methodologies allow designing
"software to break down into manageable parts called ""user"
"stories."" Pedrycz suggests that this underline Agile 's value for the"
"consumer, allowing developers to deliver quicker input loops and"
maintain product compatibility with business needs [3]. Agile also
"supports adaptive planning, evolving development, early and on-"
"going delivery, and constant improvement to enable developers"
"to respond quickly and flexibly to customer needs, software, and"
other external factors.
