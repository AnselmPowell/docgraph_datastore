Part of this\nprocess is CI/CD, which embodies mostly the first parts, right up to\nthe deployment.\nDespite the many benefits of DevOps and CI/CD, it\nstill presents many challenges promoted by the tremendous proliferation\nof different tools, languages, and syntaxes, which makes the field quite\nchallenging to learn and keep up to date.\nSoftware repositories contain data regarding various software practices,\ntools, and uses. This data can help gather multiple insights that inform\ntechnical and academic decision-making. GitHub is currently the most\npopular software hosting platform and provides a search API that lets\nusers query its repositories.\nOur goal with this paper is to gain insights into the technologies de-\nvelopers use for CI/CD by analyzing GitHub repositories. Using a list of\nthe state-of-the-art CI/CD technologies, we use the GitHub search API\nto find repositories using each of these technologies. We also use the API\nto extract various insights regarding those repositories. We then organize\nand analyze the data collected.\nFrom our analysis, we provide an overview of the use of CI/CD tech-\nnologies in our days, but also what happened in the last 12 years. We\nalso show developers use several technologies simultaneously in the same\nproject and that the change between technologies is quite common. From\nthese insights, we find several research paths, from how to support the use\nof multiple technologies, both in terms of techniques, but also in terms of\nhuman-computer interaction, to aiding developers in evolving their CI/CD\npipelines, again considering the various dimensions of the problem.\n1\narXiv:2402.17588v1  [cs.SE]  27 Feb 2024",
    "2": "1\nIntroduction\nIn 2022 the Information Technology (IT) market accounted for $9,325.69 bil-\nlion dollars worldwide [Company(2022)].\nHalf of IT costs are related to the\nmaintenance and upkeep of existing systems, and of those, 50% correspond to\nemergencies, unplanned work, and changes [Kim et al.(2016)]. This cost hap-\npens partially because the IT and development team’s goals often conflict in\nmost organizations. Instead of working for a common goal, most organizations’\ndevelopment teams are responsible for reacting to and answering rapid changes\nin markets and customer needs. In contrast, IT teams provide customers with\na secure, reliable, and stable experience. This dynamic leads to technical debt,\nmeaning decisions made over time lead to increasingly more complex problems\nand slower operations and thus impede the achievement of the organization’s\ngoals [Kim et al.(2016)].\nIn recent years, DevOps, that is, the integration of development and IT\nteams seamlessly, has emerged to enable organizations to respond to market de-\nmands with unparalleled agility hoping to address the aforementioned problems.\nIn particular, methodologies and technologies for Continuous Integration, Con-\ntinuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment, or simply CI/CD, have emerged\nas a means for organizations to achieve rapid and frequent delivery of changes.\nA CI/CD pipeline encompasses a series of essential steps involved in integrat-\ning and deploying codebase changes [Kim et al.(2016)]. This process involves\nthe regular integration of new code changes, which undergo automated build-\ning and testing procedures. Subsequently, the validated code is deployed into\nproduction through the CD process [Kim et al.(2016)].\nOrganization have the option to employ various technologies like GitHub\nActions1, GitLab CI/CD2, Travis CI3, CircleCI4 or Jenkins5. The wide range\nof existing technologies makes it harder for researchers and developers to study\nand improve the CI/CD process. Indeed, there is no view of the usage of CI/CD\ntechnologies in a global sense, e.g., most used technologies, their evolution over\ntime, which kinds of projects most rely on CI/CD, and so on.\nGitHub is a widely used version control and software hosting service. As of\n2023, more than 100 million developers used GitHub, and the platform hosted\nover 284 million public repositories [Kyle Daigle(2023)]. GitHub also provides\nan API to collect information from its software repositories. With this API,\nwe can search repositories inside GitHub using parameters such as keywords in\ntheir name and README, size, number of stars, followers, and forks6. The\ninsights collected using the API help understand various developer behaviors\nand have been used in several studies [Haque et al.(2020), Henkel et al.(2020),\nGolzadeh et al.(2022), Liu et al.(2023), Calefato et al.(2022)]. Indeed, in this\n1https://github.com/features/actions\n2https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/\n3https://www.travis-ci.com/\n4https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity\n5https://www.jenkins.io/\n6https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search\n2",
    "3": "work, we build on GitHub to gain insights into how developers use several\nCI/CD technologies. The information collected can guide future research on\npossible improvements to the DevOps process and in particular for CI/CD.\nWith this work, we thus aim to answer the following research questions:\nRQ1 What characterizes the current landscape of CI/CD?\nIn addressing Research Question 1 (RQ1), our objective is to gain a com-\nprehensive understanding of the prevailing utilization of diverse CI/CD\ntechnologies. Our aim is to identify patterns that can serve as catalysts\nfor future (research) endeavors, both within industrial and academic con-\ntexts.\nFrom our sample of repositories, containing 612557 individuals, we know\nthat about 32.7% include some CI/CD technology. In Section 4 we ex-\nplore the most used technologies and their relationship with programming\nlanguages. Indeed, projects in some languages do not rely often on CI/CD\nwhich deserves further investigation and possibly better solutions for those\ndevelopers.\nRQ2 Can a single CI/CD technology adequately meet the needs of a specific\nproject?\nWith RQ2, our goal is to understand to which extent the technologies can\nserve the projects’ needs.\nIndeed, we have discovered that 30271 projects use at least two technolo-\ngies and that some (few cases) use up to 13 different technologies at the\nsame time. This motivates further investigation on the interoperability of\nthe different technologies and the support developers have to work with\nmultiple CI/CD technologies at the same time.\nRQ3 What is the evolution of CI/CD usage over time?\nWith this research question, our goal is to find how projects change over\ntime regarding the CI/CD technologies used. Our goal is also to get an\noverview of changes in pipelines over time.\nOver the years, there have been two major technologies used. Moreover,\nit is clear that developers often change technologies. Since currently there\nis little support for these evolutions, this paves a very interesting path for\nfuture research.\nWe organize the rest of the document as follows: Section 2 presents several\nworks related to our own.\nThose works focus on mining information about\nseveral DevOps aspects in various software repositories. In Section 3, we present\nthe methodology used for this work. This methodology includes how we found\nthe CI/CD technologies for this study, what information we have collected from\nthe repositories and how it is related to our research questions, how we used the\nGitHub API to collect information from the repositories, and how we organized\nthe data collected from the said repositories.\nIn Sections 4, 5, and\n6, we\n3",

Finally, Section 9\npresents our conclusions and future work.\n2\nRelated work\nIn this section, we introduce our related work. This paper’s related work focuses\non several articles that mine software repositories to understand and improve\naspects of software development. Similarly to these works, we mine repositories\nrelated to the CI/CD.\nXu et al. [Xu and Marinov(2018)] introduce the idea of mining container\nimage repositories for configuration and other deployment information of soft-\nware systems. The authors also showcase the opportunities based on concrete\nsoftware engineering tasks that can benefit from mining image repositories.\nThey also summarize the challenges of analyzing image repositories and the\napproaches that can address these challenges. These authors focus their work\non technologies for deployment, while with our work we give a broader overview\nof the usage of CI/CD technologies.\nWu et al. [Wu et al.(2020)] present a preliminary study on 857,086 Docker\nbuilds from 3,828 open-source projects hosted on GitHub. Using the Docker\nbuild data, the authors measure the frequency of broken builds and report their\nfix times. They also explore the evolution of Docker build failures across time.\nThis work is focused on a particular technology, whilst ours covers many.\nZahedi et al. [Zahedi et al.(2020)] present an empirical study exploring con-\ntinuous software engineering from the practitioners’ perspective by mining dis-\ncussions from Q&A websites. The authors analyzed 12,989 questions and an-\nswers posted on Stack Overflow. The authors then used topic modeling to derive\nthe dominant topics in this domain. They then identify and discuss key chal-\nlenges. Although the studied topic is related to CI/CD, we analyzed concrete\nsoftware projects.\nMazrae et al. [Rostami Mazrae et al.(2023)] present a qualitative study of\nCI/CD technologies usage, co-usage, and migration based on in-depth inter-\nviews. They identify reasons for the use of specific technologies, reasons for\nco-usage of CI/CD technologies in the same project, and migrations executed\nby the interviewees. Their study reveals a clear trend in migration from Travis\nto GitHub Actions. We have used a very different source of data, but some of\nthe conclusions of our study are in line with Mazrae et al.\nGoldazeh et al. [Golzadeh et al.(2022)] conduct a qualitative analysis of the\nusage of seven popular CI technologies in the GitHub repositories of 91m810\nactive npm packages having used at least one CI service over a period of nine\nyears. Their findings include the fall of Travis, the rapid rise of GitHub Actions,\nand the co-usage of multiple CI technologies. These results are in line with ours,\nbut we have investigated many more projects and CI/CD technologies.\nLiu et al. [Liu et al.(2023)] mine 84,475 open-source Android applications\n4",

Their approach is similar\nto ours however, our analysis is done with a greater sample of 612557 repositories\nand we don’t limit ourselves to Android applications.\nCalefato et al. [Calefato et al.(2022)] study MLOps (that is, DevOps but\nfocused on machine learning projects) practices in GitHub repositories, focus-\ning on GitHub Actions and CML. Their preliminary results suggest that the\nadoption of MLOps workflows is rather limited. On the other hand, we have\nfound that, indeed, many projects rely on CI/CD pipelines.\nKumar et al. [Kumar et al.(2022)] assess the maturity of DevOps practices\nin the software industry. To this end, they analyze the HELENA2 dataset (an\ninternational survey aiming to collect data regarding the common use of software\nand systems in practice). They rank organizations by DevOps maturity. The\nauthors conducted a user survey while we analyzed software repositories.\n3\nData collection\nThis section details the process we followed to collect the data for our analysis.\nFig. 1 presents an overall view that we detail in the following paragraphs.\n3.1\nRepository Sampling\nThe initial data collection phase involved assembling a representative sample\nof GitHub repositories, reflective of real-world projects.\nTo achieve this, we\nexcluded school projects and smaller repositories, employing a methodology\ninspired by prior research projects. That is, we focused on repositories attaining\na certain level of popularity, ultimately choosing to collect only those with more\nthan ten stars, accounting for a mere 5% of all GitHub repositories.\nThe sampling process encompassed repositories from the beginning of 2012 to\nOctober 18, 2023. This timeframe was selected because the concept of DevOps\ngained prominence around that period.\nThis assertion is supported by the\nemergence of the first comprehensive survey on the state of DevOps by Puppet\nLabs in the same year [by Perforce(2023)].\nLeveraging the GitHub REST API, we devised a methodology to identify\nthe top one thousand repositories with the highest star count each week. That\nis, we queried GitHub and got one thousand repositories every week in the time\nrange. From these, we excluded the ones with fewer than ten stars. This ap-\nproach yielded a comprehensive dataset, totaling 612,557 repositories, spanning\nthe specified date range. The entire dataset of repositories is provided for ref-\nerence [Author(2023b)]. The code used to create this dataset is also available\n[Anonymous(2023a)].\n5",

We identified pertinent artifacts and pat-\nterns for each technology in the dataset, enabling us to automatically recognize\nrepositories utilizing those technologies.\nThis process involved analyzing file\ntrees accessed through the GitHub REST API and scrutinizing file contents\nwith extensions compatible with the respective technologies. Each technology\nwas identified using one of two heuristics: i) some technologies use files with a\nparticular extension; ii) for the others, we inspected specific types of files (e.g.,\nYAML files) searching for content specific to the underlying technology. From\nthis process, we divided the initial 61 technologies into different categories: i)\n39 technologies that we could identify (Table 1); ii) 10 which we could not\nidentify since there was not a clear artifact that we could use (Table 2); iii) 4\n6",

To ensure repro-\nducibility, we recorded the SHA of the file tree (available in the database of our\ndataset). A total of 200,023 repositories were identified as utilizing one or more\nof the CI/CD technologies identified in the previous section. The comprehensive\ndataset containing the repositories and the corresponding technologies is also\nmade available for further examination [Author(2023a)]. We use this dataset\nto analyze the state of CI/CD according to the most recent snapshots. The\ncode used to create this dataset and the figures to support our answers to the\nresearch questions are also available [Anonymous(2023a)].\nTo examine the past state of CI/CD, we retrieved snapshots of repositories\nover time and ran the same CI/CD technologies analysis on each snapshot.\nThe comprehensive dataset containing the repositories and the correspond-\ning snapshots and technologies is also made available for further examination\n[Author(2023c)]. The code used to create this dataset and the figures to support\nour answers to the research question are also available [Anonymous(2023b)].\nWe ran a test on a random sample of 85 repositories to choose the time inter-\nval for the analysis. Snapshots were retrieved at 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day\nintervals for each repository. For each snapshot, we then ran CI/CD technolo-\ngies analysis. Our goal was to determine the number of changes in the CI/CD\ntech stack we would lose by increasing the retrieval interval, a change being\nany difference in the CI/CD stack compared to the previous snapshot. For the\nsample, we found 270 stack changes at a 90-day sampling interval, 217 changes\nat a 180-day sampling interval, and 179 changes at a 365-day sampling interval.\nFrom a 90-day to a 180-day rate, there was a 19.6% decrease in the detected\nchanges, and from a 180-day to a 365-day rate, there was a 17.5% decrease in\ndetected changes. A lower sampling interval, or retrieving all commits for each\nrepository, was not feasible due to GitHub API rate limits and the time for the\nstudy. Based on these results, we determined to run our analysis at a 90-day\nsampling rate.\nA subset of the previously selected repositories was analyzed. The inclusion\ncriteria were repositories where CI/CD technologies were detected in the latest\ncommit and created before July 16, 2023 (so they were at least 90 days old).\nThis resulted in a subset containing 197504 repositories.\nFor each selected repository, the first commit was retrieved. A sequential\niterative process was employed, where the latest commit (if one existed) was\nretrieved for each 90-day interval starting from either January 1, 2012 or the\nrepository’s first commit date, whichever was later. This process continued until\nthe date of the repository’s last update at the time of retrieval. All commits\nwere retrieved from the default branch of the repository. The git trees of the\n8",
    "9": "snapshot commits were then examined for CI/CD technology presence using the\npreviously described methodology.\nAfter all repositories were processed, we cleaned the retrieved data. Any\nsnapshots from before January 1, 2012, were discarded, and the last snapshot\nof each repository was set to the one used in the previous analysis. For some\nsnapshots, the GitHub API could not return a git tree. We attempted to process\nthese snapshots again to eliminate any momentary API malfunction. The orig-\ninal detection method for GitHub Actions could lead to false detection when\nother technologies were present in the snapshot, so we reprocessed all snap-\nshots that had more than one technology detected and GitHub Actions present.\nLastly, we checked each snapshot’s date and detected technologies against the\ndetected technologies’ launch dates and removed snapshots where a technology\nwas detected before it was launched. If, at the end of these cleaning steps, a\nrepository was left without snapshots, it was discarded.\nFrom an initial 197504 repositories selected for temporal analysis, we re-\ntrieved the CI/CD technology use history of 197410. For the 94 repositories\nwhose CI/CD technology history could not be retrieved, the reasons are as fol-\nlows: the 19 repositories could not be processed in the initial snapshot retrieval\nbecause they had either been deleted or gone private, in the data cleaning step,\nanother 39 repositories could not be processed because they had either been\ndeleted or gone private, and 36 were discarded because they had no snapshots\nat the end of the cleaning steps.\n4\nRQ1:\nWhat characterizes the current land-\nscape of CI/CD?\nBy answering this RQ we intend to provide a clear and accurate overview of the\ncurrent usage of CI/CD technologies in the open-source realm.\nCI/CD usage\nWe collected 612,557 created between 2012 and 2023, that is, between the be-\nginning of the establishment of DevOps and now. From these, 200,023, 32.7%,\ncontain at least one CI/CD technology.\nThis means about one third of the\nrepositories in the last twelve years have, or had, some CI/CD support.\nIn Fig. 2, we depict the distribution of technologies within CI/CD projects,\nexclusively focusing on technologies whose usage exceeds 1% of the total repos-\nitories containing CI/CD technologies. In the online appendix of this paper7,\nwe present a chart with all the technologies. In fact, we present several other\ncharts in this appendix. The figure indicates that GitHub Actions significantly\ndominates the landscape, being present in more than half (57.8%) of the repos-\nitories, with Travis trailing as the second most utilized technology (38.8%).

Notably, among the 39 technologies\nanalyzed, only ten surpass the 1% usage threshold across CI/CD repositories.\nFigure 2: Distribution of technologies across CI/CD repositories (in a logarith-\nmic scale).\nThe predominance of GitHub Actions seems to indicate that repository plat-\nforms have quite some influence, at least in the projects they hold. Thus, a\npossible conclusion is that, when considering the usage of CI/CD technology,\ndevelopers also consider where the code will be managed.\nCI/CD and programming languages\nFig. 3 illustrates the number of repositories of each programming language with\na usage rate exceeding 1% in repositories employing at least one CI/CD tech-\nnology. We use the GitHub API to get the main programming language of each\nrepository (which does not mean the project does not use other languages).\nNotably, based on this depiction, JavaScript and Python emerge as the most\nextensively utilized languages. In absolute terms, these languages are the ones\nwhere more projects include CI/CD technologies.\nA comparison of the lan-\nguages highlighted in the IEEE Spectrum’s top programming languages of 2023\n[IEEE(2023)] reveals noteworthy disparities. While SQL and R claim top posi-\ntions in IEEE Spectrum’s ranking, they are absent from our list. This discrep-\nancy may be attributed to SQL often being embedded within other program-\nming languages and R being predominantly utilized by less technically inclined\n10",

The figure indicates that languages like Go, Rust,\nand TypeScript exhibit the highest prevalence of CI/CD use within their reposi-\ntories. Notably, despite Python and JavaScript having a substantial presence in\nCI/CD repositories, as illustrated in Fig. 3, they show a lower overall percentage\nof repositories utilizing CI/CD technologies.\nThis data seems to indicate more recent languages (e.g., Go, Kotlin, Rust,\nTypeScript) tend to include CI/CD in their projects, in some cases having\nmore than 60% of all projects some technology. On the other hand, more classic\nlanguages (e.g., C, C#, HTML, Shell) seem to have less support from CI/CD\ntechnologies. From this, a possible conclusion is that CI/CD technologies find\na better fit in modern languages and not so much in pre-existing ones.\nFig. 5 reveals that GitHub Actions and Travis stand out as the predominant\ntechnologies utilized across various programming languages.\nNotably, Travis\n11",

Conversely, languages such as JavaScript are\nmore prevalent in projects utilizing Travis. This observation implies that newer\nprojects tend to favor GitHub Actions, indicating a potential trend of migration\nfrom Travis to GitHub Actions, particularly in numerous JavaScript projects.\n5\nRQ2:\nCan a single CI/CD technology ade-\nquately meet the needs of a specific project?\nWith this RQ we intend to understand the co-usage of several CI/CD technolo-\ngies among the projects.\nFig. 6 displays the logarithmic distribution of the number of CI/CD technolo-\ngies employed across repositories with at least one such technology.

To the best of our knowledge, the interoperability of\nthese technologies has not been properly studied. This deserves an investigation\nof its own. Moreover, CI/CD supporting tools (e.g., editors) are not tailored\nfor co-usage, which makes their co-usage more difficult for developers. Thus, to\nstudy how to aid developers in these projects becomes an interesting research\npath.\nIn Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we present the number and percentage of repositories us-\ning (at most) a certain number of technologies. Some repositories have no single\ntechnology because, at a certain point (most likely, in their beginning), they did\nnot use CI/CD. In the first few years, one can see that the vast majority used just\none technology, but that number quickly rose. In the last 4 years, at least 23,000\nrepositories (per year) use more than one technology (Fig. 9).

As can be seen, all the projects written in these languages use, on\naverage, more than one CI/CD technology.\nThis reinforces our previous conclusions: the usage of multiple technologies\nis quite present and deserves further study and support.\n6\nRQ3: What is the evolution of CI/CD usage\nover time?\nWith this RQ, we intend to understand the usage of CI/CD over the last 12\nyears.\nWe start by analyzing the usage of CI/CD starting in 2012 until now. For\nFig. 12, we count the number of repositories created each year where, in their\nlast commit, there is the presence of CI/CD technologies. As can be seen, even\nin repositories from 2012, almost one quarter included at least one technology;\n16",

The drop in the last year is justified\nbecause many projects start without CI/CD, and only later, it is introduced.\nAs seen in Fig. 13, CI/CD technologies are being integrated into the devel-\nopment workflow sooner as time goes on. CI/CD’s increasing popularity is due\nto older, possibly more complex, projects’ adoption and new, perhaps simpler,\nprojects that see value in continuous practices. The sharp decreases in 2022 and\n2023 come from all analyzed repositories having at least one CI/CD technology\nin 2023.\nUsage of different technologies\nA repository may use more than one technology at a time, as seen in Fig. 14. The\ntechnologies used in a repository in a given year are the union of the technologies\nof the snapshots retrieved in that year. In cases where a repository does not\nhave any snapshots in a given year but has activity following that year, the\ntechnologies used for that year are the ones in the most recent snapshot up to\nthat point in time, i.e., if a repository has snapshots in 2016 and 2018, but\nnot in 2017, its used technologies in 2017 are the ones from the last snapshot\nfrom 2016. If a repository has no activity following a given year, its technology\n18",
    "19": "Figure 12: The usage of CI/CD per year.\nusage stops being considered. This methodology applies to all charts showing\ntechnology usage over time.\nFig. 14 shows two significant trends in CI/CD, Travis and GitHub Actions.\nTravis usage steadily increased from 2012 until it peaked in 2019 with 73284\nrepositories (36.6%). Since 2019, Travis’s usage has been declining. This coin-\ncides with the rapid adoption of GitHub Actions; from 2019 to 2020, there was\na 502.8% growth in the number of repositories using GitHub Actions, and from\n2020 to 2021, there was an 86.6% growth. Of the 36587 repositories that used\nTravis in 2019 and were still active in 2023, 59.7% were using GitHub Actions\nand not Travis in 2023, 21.1% used Travis and not GitHub Actions, and 16.9%\nused both. Of the 87582 repositories using GitHub Actions in 2023, 45.4% had\nno snapshots from before 2020. The exodus from Travis and the influx from\nnewer repositories have been the main drivers for GitHub Actions growth.\nFrom this data, we can see a shift in the CI/CD technologies used over the\nyears. This could mean developers tend to change their technologies and may\nneed support for doing so. We thus investigate this shift further on.\nFig. 15 shows the top 10 CI/CD stack transitions from repositories that\nsolely used Travis in 2019. While many stop being active, 22.9% moved from\nTravis to GitHub Actions. If we consider only the ones active, this 53.7% of all\nactive Travis projects moved to GitHub Actions while.\nFrom this information, we can conclude that developers actually change\nCI/CD technologies. However, there is little support for this kind of change.\n19",

Since 2021, this number has remained stable at almost 8%.\nThis is a very significant result since it shows that every year, between 2.3%\n(in 2013) and 12.6% (in 2021) of all snapshots include some kind of change\nin the CI/CD technologies used. This represents a very significant amount of\ntechnologies’ shift, with all the known issues with that. Moreover, it is important\nto notice that this constant over time and there is no reason to think this\nmay change in a near future. This means the research community can give a\nsignificant contribution to aid all these teams when they migrate and evolve\ntheir systems.\nIf we limit this analysis to a subset of active repositories from 2012 to 2023\n(Fig. 17), we find similar trends but higher change percentages over time.

Although one could expect some\nstability over the years for mature projects, this is not the case as can been seen\nin the data. This reinforces the need for the research community to provide\nsupport for these changes.\n7\nDiscussion\nWe have analyzed the 12 years of the usage of CI/CD. Answering RQ1, from the\nmore than 600 thousand repositories collected, almost one third, 32.7%, includes\nCI/CD technologies. This number is expected to grow as many projects start\nwithout the usage of CI/CD, which is added in later phases. We can also see one\nof the current technologies dominates the market, with 57.8% of the projects\nusing GitHub Actions. This number may be biased as we used GitHub as our\nsource of projects, but, if this is the case, it means the source code manager has\na significant impact in the choice of CI/CD technologies.\nRegarding the relationship with programming languages, it is possible to\n23",
    "24": "conclude some languages are more related to the usage of CI/CD than others.\nIn particular, more recent languages, such as TypeScript, Go, or Rust have a\nhigher percentage of projects with CI/CD than languages such as C, Java, or\nC#. This may indicate a technological-generational gap between languages and\nCI/CD technologies, which should further be studied aiming to improve the\nadoption of CI/CD by older languages.\nAnother interesting aspect is the fact that top-used languages such as R\n[IEEE(2023)] do not have projects that include CI/CD in a significant amount.\nThis may indicate this kind of technology is not of easy adoption by less tech-\nnically skilled users, as R is often used by researchers and mathematicians.\nA surprising aspect we discovered during our work related to RQ2 is that\nmany projects use more than one technology for CI/CD. In fact, up to 13\ntechnologies may be used at the same time.\nIn the last 4 years, each year,\nmore than 23,000 projects include more than one technology, which accounts\nfor about 20% of all projects. From this, is possible to answer RQ2 negatively,\nthat is, one technology is often not sufficient to cope with all the requirements\nof some projects. This raises several future work directions. A first path is\nto endeavor a deeper investigation is required to understand exactly why this\nhappens.\nMoreover, it is necessary to investigate the interoperability of the\ntechnologies, how they work together, and how to provide the proper support for\nthese users, as existing technologies tend to have tools (e.g., editors, interpreters)\ndesigned to be used independently of others.\nIn the analysis for RQ3, we can see about a third of the repositories have\nCI/CD, a number that is relatively stable over the years. However, we have\nshown the time between the creation of the repository and the adoption of\nCI/CD has been decreasing substantially. Regarding the usage over the years,\nwith RQ3 we discovered developers tend to change quite often CI/CD technolo-\ngies. Indeed, there has been a massive change from Travis to GHA, but changes\nin technology are quite common. Indeed, in the last two years, more than 7%\nof all snapshots include some kind of change in the CI/CD technological stack.\nIf we consider long-run projects (projects running from 2012 up until now),\nthis number is even greater. This means developers need support to be suc-\ncessful in these endeavors, which currently is mostly non-existent. This opens\nquite promising research paths, including techniques to support the evolution of\nthis kind of artifacts (e.g., model-driven approaches, languages-based), but also\nfor the human-computer interaction community on how to aid these developers\nbeing more effective and efficient.\n8\nThreats to validity\nThere are multiple threats to the validity of our study, which we address in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nOur study focuses on open-source software and, in particular, on projects\nhosted on GitHub. Thus, our sampling does not include other kinds of software\n(e.g., propriety). Thus, we cannot generalize our conclusions to these other kinds\n24",
    "25": "of software projects.\nNevertheless, many companies also have their software\non GitHub, and one may expect workers from these companies to use similar\ntechnologies in other projects. Moreover, others have reached similar conclusions\nby interviewing developers [Golzadeh et al.(2022)].\nSince we only used GitHub, we cannot say these results apply to projects in\nother code repository services. However, there is no reason to consider projects\nhosted on GitHub to be significantly different from other projects in other repos-\nitory services.\nStill regarding the use of GitHub as the source of the software projects we\nanalyzed, we could observe a predominance of GitHub Actions. One of the main\nreasons for this may in fact be related to the use of GitHub as the source of\nprojects. However, we also found GitLab Actions, the CI/CD technology used\nby another repository service (GitLab).\nWe collected our sample repositories by getting the 1,000 results sent by the\nGitHub API, doing it for every week in our time frame. This gave us more than\n600,000 repositories, from which more than 200,000 have CI/CD. Although we\ncould have collected more repositories, this would increase the time to retrieve\nthem in a way that would make our work unfeasible. Moreover, the query did\nnot impose any restriction on the results, except for the 10 starts we used to have\nsome kind of “quality” metric for the projects. Thus, the repositories retrieved\nshould not be biased in any other way.\nWe considered only technologies that we could identify through files in the\nrepository. Indeed, from the 61 technologies identified by the Cloud Native Com-\nputing Foundation, we could not identify 14 technologies (plus 1 deprecated).\nNevertheless, we were able to identify 64% of all technologies.\nSome technologies are detected through file contents and we cannot guaran-\ntee a random file would not have a certain string inside that matches. However,\nwe defined content that would only make sense in the technology context, this\nprobably did not happen. In any case, if it happened, was for a very small\nnumber of files that should not change the overall conclusions of our work.\nWe assumed that the presence of CI/CD artifacts (e.g., configuration files)\nmeans the underlying project is using such a technology. However, this may not\nbe the case as some artifacts may be left forgotten from older usages.\n9\nConclusions\nIn this work, we have investigated more than 600,000 software projects, from\nwhich more than 200,000 include diverse CI/CD technologies. We have charac-\nterized the current usage of CI/CD, related the technologies with programming\nlanguages, discovered that many projects use several technologies at the same\ntime, and that projects tend to change their CI/CD technologies frequently.\nFrom this, several research paths can be seen, from better understanding why\ndevelopers need to use several technologies simultaneously and to provide the\nproper support to them, to how to aid when developers want to evolve their\ntechnologies.\n25",
