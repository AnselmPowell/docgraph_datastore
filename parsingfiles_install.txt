Installation for Local If you would like to run the partitioning logic locally, you will need to install a combination of system dependencies, as outlined in the Unstructured documentation here. For example, on Macs you can install the required dependencies with: # base dependencies brew install libmagic poppler tesseract # If parsing xml / html documents: brew install libxml2 libxslt ## I have a windows laptop how can i install these the easier way possible


✅ python-magic-bin
✅ unstructured and unstructured[local-inference]
✅ Poppler Utils (confirmed working with pdftoppm -v)
✅ Tesseract OCR (confirmed working with tesseract --version)
✅ Required XML libraries via pip installs
You can now process documents locally using these tools. Would you like to:

# Installation


pip install python-magic-bin
pip install unstructured[local-inference]
pip install lxml


# POPPLER installation

For poppler utils:
Download the pre-compiled Windows binary:


Go to: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
Download the latest release zip file

I'll guide you through extracting the poppler zip file step by step:

First, let's locate your downloaded file:

powershellCopycd C:\Users\anselm.powell\Downloads

Create a new directory for poppler in your Documents folder:

powershellCopymkdir C:\Users\anselm.powell\Documents\poppler-windows

To extract the zip file, you can use PowerShell's Expand-Archive command. Assuming the downloaded file is named "release-xxxx.zip" (replace with your actual filename):

powershellCopyExpand-Archive -Path ".\release-xxxx.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\Users\anselm.powell\Documents\poppler-windows"


Perfect! We found the bin folder. Now let's set up the correct PATH to point to this location:
powershellCopy$env:PATH += ";C:\Users\anselm.powell\Documents\poppler-windows\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin"
To make this change permanent (so you don't have to set it every time you open PowerShell), run:
powershellCopy[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\Users\anselm.powell\Documents\poppler-windows\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin",
    "User"
)
Let's verify that it's working. Try running:
powershellCopypdftoppm -v
If this works, we've successfully installed and configured poppler-utils! We can then move on to installing the next dependency (Tesseract).
Let me know if you get any errors or if the verification command works!




# TESSERACT Installation


For Tesseract:

Now let's move on to installing Tesseract. As mentioned earlier:

Download Tesseract installer:


Go to: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
Download the 64-bit version (tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.exe)


Run the installer:


When prompted, select "Just Me" (not "All Users")
Keep note of where it installs (it will likely be in C:\Users\anselm.powell\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR)

For libxml2 and libxslt:
These are actually included when you install lxml via pip, which we did in the previous step. If not:

bashCopypip install lxml
After installing these:

Create or update your user environment variables (no admin needed):

PS  
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\Users\anselm.powell\Documents\poppler-windows\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin","User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\Users\anselm.powell\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR","User")

check PS 

pdftoppm -v
tesseract --version

& "C:\Users\anselm.powell\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe" --version
